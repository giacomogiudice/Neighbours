# Neighbours | A Visualisation of Who People Don't Like
## Overview
A tool to view data from the [World Values Survey Association](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp).
It was written using the following libraries: _D3_, _jQuery_, RequireJS, _TopoJSON_ and _Datamaps_.
## Technical
For development purposes use `js/main.js` instead of `js/main.min.js`.

In order to optimise, you must have _node.js_ installed. Then do the following:
- `$ cd js/tools`,
- `$ node r.js -o build.js`,
- `$ cd ../../` to return to the main directory
