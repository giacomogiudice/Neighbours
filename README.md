# Neighbours 
## A Visualisation of Who You Don't Like
### Overview
A tool to view data from the World Values Survey Association(http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp).

### Technical
For development purposes use `js/main.js` instead of `js/main.min.js`.

In order to optimise, you must have *node.js* installed. Then do the following:
- `$ cd js/tools`,
- `$ node r.js -o build.js`,
- `$ cd ../../` to return to the main directory


======
This project was developed for Project 2 of the course Information Visualisation at KTH.
